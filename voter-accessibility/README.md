## Home to the Voter Accessibility Project

### Purpose
The right to vote should remain free, fair, and without obstruction. This project will analyze data around voter accessiblity to include voter registration laws and processes across the country, polling locations relevant to population, voter turnout factors and more.  If you are interested in how accessible the vote is to the American people, join us!

### Voter Registration

The United States ranks at the bottom of the list against other developed countries in voter turnout when looking at the eligible voting population (> 18 years old).  However, the USA rises to the top of the same list when analyzing turnout for the population that registers to vote (registered voters which voted/registered voting population) [Source.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/02/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/) Where is the gap?  Is the process to register to vote obstructed in any way?

### Polling Accessibility

How accessible is casting your vote?  Do you tend to wait hours or minutes?  This effort will aim to understand how polling locations affect voter turnout.
